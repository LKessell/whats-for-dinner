## <a id="overview">Overview</a>

This Solo Challenge was the first opportunity to create a project utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch, as well as building the HTML and CSS to match a provided comp. We were also able to personalize our projects by choosing from a selection of extensions to complete. Specific technical goals included:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Listening and responding to user events
- Adhering to SRP and DRY principles while writing code
- Reinforcing DOM manipulation skills
