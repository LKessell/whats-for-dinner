# What's for Dinner?

## Table of Contents

## Overview

This Solo Challenge was the first opportunity to create a project utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch, as well as building the HTML and CSS to match a provided comp. We were also able to personalize our projects by choosing from a selection of extensions to complete. Specific technical goals included:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Listening and responding to user events
- Adhering to SRP and DRY principles while writing code
- Reinforcing DOM manipulation skills

## How to Use the App

Make planning your next meal simple! Select the desired type of dish and click the Let's Cook! button to generate a random dish of that type. Selecting the Entire Meal option will generate a random side, main dish, and dessert to inspire a full meal. Keep clicking for more randomly-generated inspiration.
